# NetScope – Browser Network Intelligence Dashboard

A Chrome extension that transforms your browser's network activity into an intuitive, privacy-focused visualization tool for developers, learners, and privacy-conscious users.

## Refined Core Value Proposition

"NetScope bridges the gap between technical network monitoring and user-friendly privacy insights. It's DevTools for developers meets privacy dashboard for everyone — revealing not just what your browser connects to, but why it matters."

## Enhanced Core Features

1. **Smart Request Categorization**

   - Content & Media (images, videos, fonts)
   - Analytics & Tracking (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel)
